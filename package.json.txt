Notes :
=======


Scripts/tasks :

start: no need, default mode running root server.js will be used, that's ok

nodemon : used to run local nodemon in case it's not installed in global


Dependencies :

jsdom@3 is a mandatory dependency of json-htmlize on node.js
        it must NOT be upgraded to v5

webkit-devtools-agent : must be present for allowing some debugs, just in case.
REMOVED seems uncompatible with node 0.12
    "webkit-devtools-agent": "~0.3",

                   https://byteofbits.com/solving-the-environmental-variable-problem/
