About file structure :

We like auto reload/relaunch of our app. However, watching node_modules or bower_components
put a strain on the machine.
Even if those dirs can be excluded, they are excluded by a software filter but still watched by the fs.
Our dir structure outlines a clear server/ client/ common/ :
* Everything that should cause a client reload should be in /client or /common (including server dust templates)
* Everything that should cause a server reload should be in /server or /common
* Everything heavy that should NOT be watched (bower components, node modules)
  should NOT be in either client/ server/ or common/
